If you have been searching the last days to do something with your intermediate Python Skills, here is the perfect project for you. This is more complicated than building another boring game that already exists.  You need better coding skills and especially some knowledge in Object Oriented Programming. But it will be fullfilling, I promise. If this sounds interesting, follow me: 

# Writing an API Wrapper

The Project, I propose to you, is writing an API Wrapper for a REST API. I know this sound kinda boring at first, but hear me out.

Writing an API Wrapper has many advantages:

1. There are many APIs out there
2. It develops your OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Skills, which are easy to learn, but difficult to master
3. you can publish it afterwards on PYPI
4. if you publish it, you will have to write some documentation and code clean, a very valuable skill
5. It is a good skill to show to someone
6. its fun

Let me Explain: 

### 1. there are many APIS

There are hundreds of thousands of APIs out there, everyone of them working with something different. Oftentimes, the public APIs you will see come from news organizations like the [**New York Times API**](https://developers.nytimes.com/), [**The Guardian**](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/) or even smaller news outlets, for example in Germany the [**Zeit Newspaper**](developer.zeit.de). This is the one I chose for my project. Search for a newspaper in your region and look whether they have a API, you will find something. 

There are other APIs too, for example many Weather APIs or Imagery APIs. Take a look at this [list of apis](https://public-apis.io/) to get something

### 2. OOP Skills

If you write a Package in Python you will need some Object Oriented Skills, you cant get around that. But once you get the hang of it, it is *relatively* easy, if you know how to solve problems. And if you write a wrapper, you will code a lot of classes, interact with JSON and many more things, and you will grow from this challenge, at least I did

### 3. Publish

If you think you are finished with your package, you can publish it on PYPI. This is the central package authority for python packages, it is the one from where you download things like pandas or jupyter with *pip* . Once you upload something there, it will be accessible for everyone out there, who knows python. Cool and Scary at the same time

### 4. Writing Clean code

Well, if you decide to publish your package, you will have to write readable code. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it should be understandable. You will write a lot of *docstrings* for your classes and functions, you have to choose good names for everything and maybe even write some Documentation for it. I can tell you, this will take time getting used to, but in the End it is a very valuable skill to write good code.

### 5. Good to show

If you have a **Github ** Account and decide to write a package, it will be very easy to show someone. You can give them the link to the package on [PYPI.org](pypi.org) or to your documentation, that you can publish for free on GitHub Pages. This will be impressive to everyone

### 6. Fun

Trust me, it will be fun. The Feeling to solve a Error because you find the mssing Comma somewhere in your code, is just wonderful
